# VR-modelling-system

This is a simple VR based box modeling system developed at The Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark.

The system is implemented using Unity3D but it is based on the GEL library as regarding the underlying mesh representation.

Originally, the system was developed by Valerii Kamalov as part of his MSc thesis. The system was later improved by Morten Nobel-Jørgensen, Egill Ingi Jacobsen, Lars Kofoed Jensen, and Andreas Bærentzen. The system has been developed as part of research undertaken by Andreas Bærentzen.
