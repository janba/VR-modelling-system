# VR-modelling-system

This is a simple VR based box modeling system developed at The Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark.

The system is implemented using Unity3D but it is based on the GEL library as regarding the underlying mesh representation.

Originally, the system was developed by Valerii Kamalov as part of his MSc thesis. The system was later improved by Morten Nobel-Jørgensen, Egill Ingi Jacobsen, Lars Kofoed Jensen, and Andreas Bærentzen. The system has been developed as part of research undertaken by Andreas Bærentzen.

## Use

Please clone or download and try out this system (using Unity3D ver. 2019.4.18). If you make changes that might be valuable - bugfixes or improvements, I would be grateful if you let me know. Possibly they can be included in a new version. 

## Licensing

The project has been placed under the GPLv3 license. However, the license does not pertain to GEL parts of which are included in binary form and parts of which are included in source form (src/PyGEL). The license pertains only to the scripts created for this particular project.
