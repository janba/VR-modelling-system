""" PyGEL.gel is a collection of classes and functions that expose features in the
GEL library. The primary purpose of PyGEL (and GEL) is to be useful for geometry
processing tasks. Especially tasks that involve 3D polygonal meshes.

Since the representation of meshes is halfedge based, we are not restricted to
triangles. On the other hand, the library must keep the connectivity information
up to date.

The principal features of PyGEL are

1. Manifold class: a halfedge mesh representation.
2. GLManifoldViewer class: an OpenGL based viewer for Manifold.
3. I3DTree class: a kD-tree data structure for 3D point clouds.
4. MeshDistance class: a data structure for distance queries.
5. A fairly rich library of functions are available for the
Manifold class, allowing users to simplify, optimize, triangulate, refine,
or otherwise manipulate general polygon meshes.
